Assignment 9. Change management

In this file, we briefly describe the roles of subwindows that we see in the screenshot.

First off, we see the screen divided up into windows.

In the top left window, we see a record of all of the commits in a list view, as well as a branch view that displays
merging, branching, etc.

In the top middle window, we see the author for each commit, and their email address as well. 

In the top right window, we see the date of each commit.
Note: times are formatted YYYY-MM-DD.

In the middle window (across the whole screen), we see the SHA1 ID for each commit and the current row.
Additionally, we see a search bar to find commits containing certain text below the SHA1 ID and row number.

In the bottom left window, we see the details about the commit that we currently have selected in the top windows.
We see the author, committer, parent, child, branches, follows, precedes, etc.

In the bottom right window, we see the files modified by the commit.

Assignment 3. Modifying and rewriting software

Homework Questions 1-4

Q1. The patch improves the performance of ls because now the command's 
performance is more consistent with the order of the flags given, so 
its outcome is more predictable. In terms of the time efficiency for 
the ls -aA command in this lab, the time performance is technically 
worse because an extra check needs to be made to not display the "." 
and ".." directories.

Q2. If my company adopts this patched version of Coreutils instead 
of the default one, I would watch out for anything that may have been 
overriden when I introduced my patch.

Q3. When the script is invoked on an empty file like /dev/null, it 
throws the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.14/lib/python2.7/random.py", line 277, in 
  choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is 
    empty
IndexError: list index out of range

It throws this error because the chooseline() function has nothing inputted to 
it since the file is empty. Then, the chooseline() function calls 
random.choice() with an empty sequence as input, but random.choice() raises an
IndexError when an empty sequence is inputted.

Q4. When the script is invoked with python3 instead of python2, it throws the 
following error:
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

It throws this error because the line "except IOError as (errno, strerror):" 
is not valid python3 code. In python3, it should be written as 
"except IOError as err:".

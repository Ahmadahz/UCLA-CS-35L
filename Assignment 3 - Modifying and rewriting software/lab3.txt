Assignment 3. Modifying and rewriting software

Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package

1. Command: [wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz]
		[wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig]
			[wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg]
	[gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig]
First, we use the wget command to download the Coreutils 8.29 source code 
compressed tarball, the signature file, and the GNU keyring as well. Then 
we run the gpg command to verify its signature. After running all the 
previous commands, we receive the following error message: "WARNING: This 
key is not certified with a trusted signature! There is no indication that 
the signature belongs to the owner." This error occurs because it is a public 
key and has not been specifically validated by me. 

2. Command: [tar -xf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz]
We use the tar command to "unzip" the file. The -x means to extract the files 
from an archive, and the -f means to use archive file or device ARCHIVE. This 
creates a directory named "coreutils-8.29".
Command: [cd coreutils-8.29]
We use the cd command to go into our coreutils-8.29 directory.
Command: [emacs INSTALL]
We use emacs to view the INSTALL file to view installation instructions. We 
find that we can specify an installation prefix, where the prefix is an 
absolute file name, so we use that command next.
Command: [./configure --prefix=/u/ch/ugrad/bradley/coreutilsCopy]
We then execute the configure script in the coreutils-8.29 directory to 
first configure the package. The configure script creates a Makefile in 
each directory of the package. We use --prefix to specify an absolute path 
for the installation location, instead of /usr/local/bin by default.
Command: [make]
The make command compiles the package.
Command: [make install]
The make install command installs the programs and any data files and 
documentation (it installs the package).
I did not run into any problems.

3. (First cd into the home directory with [cd ~/])
Command: [coreutilsCopy/bin/ls -aA]
Here is the output:
'#exer1.html#'	 
.gnupg         
buildwords		    
exer3.html~       
perl5
'#exer4.diff#'	 
.local         
coreutils-8.29		    
exer4.diff	    
sameln
 .		 
 .login         
 coreutils-8.29.tar.xz	    
 exer4.html	      
 sameln~
 ..		 
 .logout        
 coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig   
 exer4.html~

 .bash_history	 
 .profile       
 coreutilsCopy	 
 gnu-keyring.gpg

 .bash_logout	 
 .profile~

 hwnwdseng.htm

 .cache		 
 .ssh	        
 exer2.diff

 .config	 
 .viminfo       
 exer2.html		    
 index.html	      
 tr
 .cshrc		 
 CS33	        
 exer2.html~		    
 junk	      
 words
 .elinks	 
 assign1.html   
 exer3.diff		    
 key1.txt
 .emacs.d	 
 assign2.html   
 exer3.html		    
 key1.txt~
 We notice that the bug has been reproduced. The directories "." and ".." are 
listed along with all the other directories, and we want to make it so the -A
 overrides the -a and doesn't output "." and "..".
 
4. (First cd into the coreutils-8.29 directory with [cd coreutils-8.29])
Command: [emacs patch.diff]
This command creates the patch.diff file. We then copy the patch from the bug 
website and then paste it inside of emacs.
Command: [patch -p1 < patch.diff]
This command applies the patch. the -p1 strips the smallest prefix containing 
1 leading slash from each file name found in the patch file.

5. Command: [autoreconf --force --install]
This command updates our make configurations.
Command: [make]
This compiles the package again.

6. [make install]
The make install command installs the programs and any data files and 
documentation (it installs the package).
[cd ~]
Go to home directory.
[coreutilsCopy/bin/ls -aA]
Output: 
'#exer1.html#'	 
.login		 
coreutils-8.29.tar.xz      
exer4.html     
sameln~
'#exer4.diff#'

 .viminfo

 buildwords	  
 exer3.html~

 .local		 
 coreutils-8.29

We notice that our fix did change the bug. 
We do not see ".." and ".".
